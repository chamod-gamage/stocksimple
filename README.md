## Stocksimple 📈

Stocksimple is a web app built for personal use but free for anyone to use at https://stocksimple.netlify.app in order to keep track of your stock portfolio in a hassle-free manner.
The framework used for this web app is React.js with your data stored long-term using your browser's localStorage!
The [Tradier Developer API](https://developer.tradier.com/) was used to source real-time and historical market data.

To see the code in action on your local development server:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to import the necessary packages
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server on `localhost:3000`

Have fun!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

TODO:
Add stuff here about how this is now a full stack app connected to MongoDB via Node.js, custom auth, etc.
